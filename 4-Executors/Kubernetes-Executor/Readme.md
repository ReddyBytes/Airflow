## Drawbacks of CeleryExecutor

1. **Resource Underutilization**: worker nodes stay idel when there is no load which results to less use of resources.

2. **Dependency on External Systems**: The CeleryExecutor requires a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) and  flower a webs erver for monitering the celery workers.

3. **Limited Isolation**: Shared environment can cause conflicts between tasks.

4. **Scaling Challenges**: Although Celery provides autoscaling features, managing the scaling of worker nodes can be complex and requires careful tuning to avoid resource contention or idle resources.


## Advantages of KubernetesExecutor

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Tasks are executed in their own Kubernetes pods, which are spun up on-demand and terminated after completion. This model reduces resource wastage and optimizes costs.

- **Isolation**: Each task runs in a separate pod, providing better isolation and allowing for different resource requirements or Docker images per task.

- **Fault Tolerance**: Leverages Kubernetes' self-healing features to handle pod failures, ensuring high availability and reliability of task executions.

- **Simplified Configuration and Scaling**: Configured via Airflow's settings and the Kubernetes API, simplifying the management of task execution environments.
