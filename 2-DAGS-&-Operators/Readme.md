## Operators
- simply operator is a Task 
- it encapsulates the logic that we are going to perform  

### 1) Action Operators

Action operators are used to perform actions such as executing shell commands, calling external services, or manipulating data.

- **PythonOperator**: Executes a Python callable.
- **BashOperator**: Executes a bash command.
- **ShellOperator**: Executes a shell command.
- **EmailOperator**: Sends an email notification.
- **SlackOperator**: Posts a message to Slack.
- **SnsPublisher**: Publishes a message to AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS).
- **PostgresOperator**: Executes a postgresql ,sql queries
- **MySQLOperator**: Executes SQL statements against a MySQL database.
- **SnowflakeOperator**: Executes SQL statements against a Snowflake database.

### 2) Transfer Operators

Transfer operators are specifically designed for moving data between locations. 

- **CopyToS3Operator**: Copies files to Amazon S3.
- **MoveFileOperator**: Moves a file from one location to another.
- **SFTPOperator**: Transfers files via SFTP.

- **TriggerRule**: Defines the trigger rule for a task, specifying when it should be executed.



## DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

- A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a collection of tasks organized by their dependencies and relationships, defining how they should run.  
-  DAGs are written in Python and placed in Airflow's designated folder, allowing for dynamic building and execution of workflows.  
- simply DAG is a data pipeline
