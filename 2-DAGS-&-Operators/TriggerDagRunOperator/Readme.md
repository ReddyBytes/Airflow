## TriggerDagRunOperator 

- `TriggerDagRunOperator` is designed to trigger the execution of another DAG from current DAG. 
- This operator is particularly useful for orchestrating complex workflows where one DAG needs to initiate the execution of another DAG based on certain conditions or events.

### Parameters

- **`trigger_dag_id`**: The ID of the DAG to trigger. This parameter supports templating.
- **`trigger_run_id`**: The run ID for the triggered DAG run. If not provided, a new run ID will be generated.
- **`conf`**: A dictionary of configuration options for the triggered DAG run, supporting templating.
- **`logical_date`**: The logical date for the DAG run, useful for scheduling purposes.
- **`reset_dag_run`**: Determines whether to clear an existing DAG run if it already exists. This is useful for resetting DAG runs without deleting them.
- **`wait_for_completion`**: Specifies whether to wait for the triggered DAG run to complete. Defaults to `False`.
- **`poke_interval`**: The interval (in seconds) to check the status of the triggered DAG run when `wait_for_completion=True`.
- **`allowed_states`**: A list of allowed states for the triggered DAG run, defaults to `['success']`.
- **`failed_states`**: A list of failed or disallowed states for the triggered DAG run, defaults to `None`.
- **`deferrable`**: Indicates whether to defer the task until the triggered DAG run completes when `wait_for_completion=True`. Defaults to `False`.


### Controller DAG

- **Definition**: The controller DAG is responsible for initiating the execution of the target DAG. It contains a `TriggerDagRunOperator` task that specifies the ID of the target DAG to be triggered.

- **Purpose**: The main goal of the controller DAG is to coordinate the execution flow by deciding when and under what conditions the target DAG should be executed.

- **Flexibility**: The controller DAG can be scheduled to run at regular intervals or triggered manually, offering flexibility in controlling the workflow.

### Target DAG

- **Definition**: The target DAG is the DAG that gets triggered by the controller DAG. It contains the actual tasks that perform the desired operations, such as data processing or analysis.

- **Purpose**: The target DAG performs the core operations of the workflow. Its execution is initiated by the controller DAG, ensuring that the workflow progresses according to the predefined logic.

- **Dependency Management**: The target DAG relies on the controller DAG to be triggered at the right moment. This dependency is managed through the `TriggerDagRunOperator` in the controller DAG.
